# Automate Sitemap and URL Submission to IndexNow ðŸ”Ž
## Why Use IndexNow?
Are you concerned about search engine optimization (SEO)? Do you want to make sure your website is indexed frequently by [Bing](https://www.bing.com/indexnow), [Yandex](https://yandex.com/indexnow), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), and other search engines?

Imagine submitting all your sitemap URLs to IndexNow when your website is updated, so that search engines know when to crawl your site again. This is what this action does.

!!! note "What is IndexNow?"
    [IndexNow](https://www.indexnow.org/) is an open source protocol that allows website owners to notify search engines when their content has changed, so that search engines can quickly crawl and index the new content. This is particularly useful for sites that update frequently or have dynamic content, and it is useful for search engines to know which pages to crawl and index since the last visit.

    By using IndexNow, you can ensure that your website is indexed more frequently, which can improve your search engine rankings and drive more traffic to your site.

    Search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/indexnow), [Yandex](https://yandex.com/indexnow), [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (via Bing's index) and others already support IndexNow, but not all search engines. For example, Google is not on board, but this may change in the future.

## How to Automatically Submit Sitemap and URLs to IndexNow
This workflow for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will automatically submit your sitemap to IndexNow for faster indexing by Bing, Yandex, DuckDuckGo and other search engines.

If you're already using GitHub Actions, simply add this action to your workflow. It can automatically submit your sitemap to IndexNow whenever you deploy changes to your site or at a specific time.

### How to Use
Example workflow that you can adjust to your needs:

```yaml linenums="1" title=".github/workflows/submit_sitemap_to_index_now.yml"
name: Submit Sitemap URLs to IndexNow

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 1 * *  # Run at midnight UTC on the 1st day of each month.

jobs:
  submit-sitemap:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Submit sitemap URLs to IndexNow
        uses: jakob-bagterp/index-now-submit-sitemap-urls-action@v1
        with:
          host: example.com
          api_key: ${{ secrets.INDEX_NOW_API_KEY }}
          api_key_location: https://example.com/${{ secrets.INDEX_NOW_API_KEY }}.txt
          endpoint: yandex
          sitemap_locations: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

Learn more in the [user guide](user-guide/getting-started.md) and find [more parameters](user-guide/parameters.md) to customise the workflow.

## Workflow Triggers
If you're using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to deploy your website, you can also use this action to automatically submit the URLs of your sitemap to IndexNow. Simply adjust the `on` trigger so that it runs after your website has been successfully deployed:

```yaml linenums="3" title=".github/workflows/submit_sitemap_to_index_now.yml"
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [pages-build-deployment]
    types: [completed]
```

There are many more [workflow trigger variations](user-guide/workflow-triggers.md) to cover your needs.
